Just a little post about sharing code and skills with the unknown.

After posting about [covidfrance app](https://guillaumepressiat.github.io/blog/2020/05/covidview), I 
[exchanged](https://gist.github.com/GuillaumePressiat/0e3658624e42f763e3e6a67df92bc6c5#gistcomment-3363830) with github users wanting to reproduce the app for their country..

I just want to say here that it was really a pleasure to exchange with people around the world like this. 
It was nice to share skills and to learn new things with problematics on new data.

No matter the manner (yes GitHub is Microsoft), peoples want to share and learn things. For what it's worth it works. 
After all I've learned from r-bloggers and GitHub, it just seems natural to "return something".
