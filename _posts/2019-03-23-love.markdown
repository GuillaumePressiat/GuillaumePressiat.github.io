*This post is an actualisation with addendum below*.


{% highlight r %}
love_verse <- function(w1, w2, w3){
  glue::glue(
  "Love is {b}, {b} is love
   Love is {y}, {y} love
   Love is {u} to be loved", 
  b = w1, y = w2, u = w3)
}
{% endhighlight %}


As a return, parameters sometimes give echoes of poetry.


{% highlight r %}
love_verse('real', 'feeling', 'wanting')
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cmd %}
Love is real, real is love
Love is feeling, feeling love
Love is wanting to be loved
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight r %}
love_verse('touch', 'reaching', 'asking')
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cmd %}
Love is touch, touch is love
Love is reaching, reaching love
Love is asking to be loved
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight r %}
## refrain
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cmd %}
Love is you
You and me
Love is knowing
We can be
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight r %}
love_verse('free', 'living', 'needing')
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cmd %}
Love is free, free is love
Love is living, living love
Love is needing to be loved
{% endhighlight %}

We could also read title of this article as "strength of an R function exposed with a Lennon song"...

## Addendum

In a more tidyverse way, you could also do this last piping block step using `glue_data` approach, what I have not thinked about. 
I haven't been able to think theses words will fit in a tibble, which is why I have used `do.call` which sounds a little like `old.school`!

With a little help from [Jim Hester](https://gist.github.com/GuillaumePressiat/f2d4ac48b12920ef501a00abf5a2fb99#gistcomment-2870511), it's getting better:

{% highlight r %}

library(magrittr)

tibble::tribble(
  ~a, ~b, ~c,
  "real", "feeling", "wanting",
  "touch", "reaching", "asking",
  "free", "living", "needing"
  ) %>%
  glue::glue_data(
  "Love is {a}, {a} is love
   Love is {b}, {b} love
   Love is {c} to be loved",
  ) %>%
  glue::glue_collapse("\n\n")
#> Love is real, real is love
#> Love is feeling, feeling love
#> Love is wanting to be loved
#> 
#> Love is touch, touch is love
#> Love is reaching, reaching love
#> Love is asking to be loved
#> 
#> Love is free, free is love
#> Love is living, living love
#> Love is needing to be loved
{% endhighlight %}
