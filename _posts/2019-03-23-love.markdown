{% highlight r %}
love_verse <- function(w1, w2, w3){
  glue::glue(
  "Love is {b}, {b} is love
   Love is {y}, {y} love
   Love is {u} to be loved", 
  b = w1, y = w2, u = w3)
}
{% endhighlight %}


As a return, parameters sometimes give echoes of poetry.


{% highlight r %}
love_verse('real', 'feeling', 'wanting')
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cmd %}
Love is real, real is love
Love is feeling, feeling love
Love is wanting to be loved
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight r %}
love_verse('touch', 'reaching', 'asking')
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cmd %}
Love is touch, touch is love
Love is reaching, reaching love
Love is asking to be loved
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight r %}
## refrain
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cmd %}
Love is you
You and me
Love is knowing
We can be
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight r %}
love_verse('free', 'living', 'needing')
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cmd %}
Love is free, free is love
Love is living, living love
Love is needing to be loved
{% endhighlight %}
